Group 17   |   LAW Kai Yuet, Ian   |   kylawah@connect.ust.hk

Ricochet is a LAN-based multiplayer game. Therefore, running this game consists of:
-	Starting the server
-	Joining the game

Instructions on how to start the server:
1.	(Optional) If you do not know your IP address on LAN, go to "cmd.exe" and type in "ipconfig" to check it.
2.	Run "Ricochet_Server.exe" and leave it open throughout the game.
3.	When the game ends, you may restart "Ricochet_Server.exe" to start a new game.

Instructions on how to join the game:
1.	(Optional) Sometimes your web browser might use your computer's integrated GPU instead of a dedicated GPU. This will severely hinder the game's performance.
	Go to "Settings" > "System" > "Display" > "Graphics settings" > "Graphics performance preference" and set the "Graphics preference" of your browser to "High performance".
2.	Open your web browser. Navigate to "http://(your server address):4141". (e.g. http://192.168.1.234:4141)
3.	The first player that connects to the server is the "host", who gets to choose the gamemode and start the game.
	Click "Start game" to start the game when all players have joined.
4.	Other players will wait for the host to start the game.
(Please wait patiently as the game loads)
